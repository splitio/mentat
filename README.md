# MENTAT - backdated impressions and events

Mentat is a script designed to create a series of impressions and events, assign them random values, and timestamp them to have begun a week in the past.

By "backdating" the impressions and events, a Split user can generate charts now, while still making it appear as if the data was collected over time.

In order for the approach to work currently...

 - You must copy-and-paste the version number of your target split.  This turns out to be tricky to find.  I can help.  david.martin@split.io

 - Your target split must have a version starting for at least three days in the past.

The target split should be a 50/50 rollout.
